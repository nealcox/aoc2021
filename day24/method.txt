separated the long program into the 14 parts
two types:
 - multiply by 26 & the "if" comparing w to x+n cannot be true as n > 10
 - divide by 26 and we can finagle the inputs

operates as a stack so w7 must reverse w6 and leave z7 equal to z5
in this way, at the end, the value of z will be that before we start: ie 0

just sort of trial and error, start with all 9s for maximum and all 1s for minumum
then by hand when there's a divide play with the numbers of w to make it fit
